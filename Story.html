  <div class="zone red container">Ruru's story
  </div>
  <div class="description-index-padded">
      Shortly after birth on July 9th 2013, Ruru was found in Kojima, Ario. She was cuter and calmer than all other dogs, including her noisy room-mate. When Miki laid eyes on Ruru, she just had to take her home.

    <div class="description-index-padded">
      Ruru spent her younger years living with Miki in Adachi. Everywhere Miki and Ruru went together people would comment "kawaii", it was soon obvious she was an especially popular puppy.

     At a few years old she moved to Kanamachi to live with Miki as well as beloved relatives Ayano and Asa. Chris also lived together with Ruru for a while. Kanamachi provided many happy memories for Ruru. She loved walking by the Edogawa river, visiting Mizumoto park and especially running around Tokyo rika daigaku park which was one of her favourite places to be! The highligh of Chris's day was a morning walk to Rika daigaku with Ruru to enjoy a coffee while playing with Ruru and her ball.
     In the evenings Ruru loved nothing more than running around the gravel filled park below her apartment, hiding in her bag to avoid detection from the apartment managament.

      Around this time Ruru went on her first hiking trip, and eventually became a real 山ガール. She loved to climb and despite her short legs, she never gave up and always wanted to climb it herself without being carried. She summited Mt Takao several times over several routes, and also took a trip to Mt Tsukuba.

    <div class="description-index-padded">
      From this time Ruru moved to her longest-staying residence in Towa. She spent her final years here with sisters Lala, Kinako, Momo and eventually Mugi. At first she found it difficult to live with so many sisters except for Lala who she had a bond with after knowing her since birth. Eventually she came to enjoy playing together and often was playing tug of war with Momo over her rope toy. She loved visiting Sunrise Kameari to visit Chris and play with her favourite rope toy in the tatami room.

    <div class="description-index-padded">
      When Ruru was diagnosed with cancer she stayed strong and was still able to live a couple of happy and energetic years. Ruru eventually passed away peacefully with her family on February 22nd 2023.
      Family and friends have many fond memories which will be cherished forever.
